# Project Name -  Travel World

We have successfully completed our Third-year, Second-semester minor project using the MERN stack. Travel world is a comprehensive Travel and Tourism website that offers convenient features such as Vehicle Reservations, Hotel Reservations(Not Included in the live website), Tour Packages, Restaurants, Train Bookings, and Event Bookings, all consolidated in one platform. To style our website, we employed Tailwind CSS. We diligently adhered to the Agile methodology throughout the project, ensuring efficient development. Furthermore, we leveraged GitHub for seamless system integration."
